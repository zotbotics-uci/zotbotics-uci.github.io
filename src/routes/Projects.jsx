    subtitle: '3 Quarters · Team size 10 · Cost: TBD',
    blurb:
      'Our most advanced project is focused on designing and building a self-leveling robot in the shape of UCI’s mascot, the anteater. This robot will be able to stand, walk, jump, and recover from falls. It requires advanced knowledge across multiple engineering domains, including controls, mechatronics, and biomechanics. Admission is application-based and best suited for experienced members ready for a challenge.',
